          <li>Enter your HTML notes here</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

            <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and
              provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the
              webpage.</li>

            <li>When we build a website, we build it step-by-step in much the same way
              as you build a house. First, we use HTML to build a sturdy frame,
              using HTML elements as our frame’s building blocks. Next, we add CSS
              to define the style. Finally, we add JavaScript to our HTML
              structure to make the website interactive.</li>

            <li>The HEAD element contains the metadata for our web application.
              Metadata
              is data about our webpage that the browser uses
              to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically
              not seen by users, but it contains important information about
              accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>

            <li>Inside the HEAD element, we can use the following metadata
              tags: The TITLE element defines the title for a webpage. This
              element is required and is extremely important for Search
              Engine Optimization (SEO). The STYLE element defines the
              CSS styles associated with a website. The
              BASE element defines the base URL for a webpage.The
              LINK element connects an external resource to the HTML
              document. The META element defines metadata such as the
              character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.

            <li>The SCRIPT element embeds client - side scripts in the HTML
              document</li>

            <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making
              sure that it
              provides a positive user experience. Because we are creating a Prework Study Guide for stressed-out boot
              camp students,
              we want to make sure that it's easy to find the information they need! And we can use HTML elements to do
              that.
              Now that we understand the importance of building a solid, user-friendly HTML structure for our webpage,
              let's take a
              closer look at the BODY elements and the nested child elements within it.</li>

            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.
              If there are three elements nested inside of a BODY element, those three
              nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all
              the children—in this case, the BODY element—is known as the
              parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used
              by developers to explain the relationship among elements
              in HTML.</li>

            <li>The BODY element defines the body of the document, which
              contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the
              content that we want to display to users must be inside the
              BODY element.</li>

            <li>The BODY element is an example of a semantic HTML element.
              In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes
              its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When
              possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements,
              because they make your HTML easier to read by other
              developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an
              important role in making sure your webpage is accessible
              to the widest variety of users, including those who use
              assistive technologies such as screen readers.
              Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common
              to see non-semantic elements such as DIV to create a
              division in the page, or SPAN to create an inline division.
              Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution
              to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve.
              The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is
              best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible,
              especially when the content is visible to users.</li>

            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is
              contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.
              These tags are most often represented by angle brackets
              with associated tag names contained inside (for example,HEAD.
              Closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, HEAD).
              We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag
              so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>

            <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used
              interchangeably in the web development world, but it is
              important to know the difference. An element refers to the
              entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a
              tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

            <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists,
              ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML
              elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
            <li>The IMG element contains information about images that are
              displayed on the webpage. The IMG element can contain
              various attributes; the src attribute is the most important
              because it defines the location of the image</li>

            <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that
              we use heading tags in order from H1 to H6 to make
              the page accessible to users who access the page using
              screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest
              heading, H1, should only appear once on each page.</li>

            <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other
              assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search
              engine rankings for your website.</li>

            <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development
              and refers to separating code into different files based
              on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice
              in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the
              idea that each section of code should have its own
              responsibility.</li>

            <li>Debugging is one of the most important parts of the
              development process. Every day, developers notice errors
              and review code that isn’t working. It’s important to get
              into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts. They
              tell us when something is wrong, and if we can stay
              curious, we can figure out what is happening and learn
              something new.</li>
