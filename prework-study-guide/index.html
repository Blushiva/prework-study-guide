      <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>

            <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>

            <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>

            <li>HTML elements work together to build the structure of a webpage and
              provide a framework that makes it easy for a user to navigate the
              webpage.</li>

            <li>When we build a website, we build it step-by-step in much the same way
              as you build a house. First, we use HTML to build a sturdy frame,
              using HTML elements as our frame’s building blocks. Next, we add CSS
              to define the style. Finally, we add JavaScript to our HTML
              structure to make the website interactive.</li>

            <li>The HEAD element contains the metadata for our web application.
              Metadata
              is data about our webpage that the browser uses
              to effectively serve our webpage to users. Metadata is typically
              not seen by users, but it contains important information about
              accessibility, search engines, and performance.</li>

            <li>Inside the HEAD element, we can use the following metadata
              tags: The TITLE element defines the title for a webpage. This
              element is required and is extremely important for Search
              Engine Optimization (SEO). The STYLE element defines the
              CSS styles associated with a website. The
              BASE element defines the base URL for a webpage.The
              LINK element connects an external resource to the HTML
              document. The META element defines metadata such as the
              character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.

            <li>The SCRIPT element embeds client - side scripts in the HTML
              document</li>

            <li>An HTML developer is responsible for not only providing the structure for the webpage but also making
              sure that it
              provides a positive user experience. Because we are creating a Prework Study Guide for stressed-out boot
              camp students,
              we want to make sure that it's easy to find the information they need! And we can use HTML elements to do
              that.
              Now that we understand the importance of building a solid, user-friendly HTML structure for our webpage,
              let's take a
              closer look at the BODY elements and the nested child elements within it.</li>

            <li>Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.
              If there are three elements nested inside of a BODY element, those three
              nested elements are known as child elements. The element that holds all
              the children—in this case, the BODY element—is known as the
              parent element. This “parent/child” language is often used
              by developers to explain the relationship among elements
              in HTML.</li>

            <li>The BODY element defines the body of the document, which
              contains the content that is visible to the user. All of the
              content that we want to display to users must be inside the
              BODY element.</li>

            <li>The BODY element is an example of a semantic HTML element.
              In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes
              its content and the role it plays on a webpage. When
              possible, it is important to use semantic HTML elements,
              because they make your HTML easier to read by other
              developers and the browser. Semantic HTML also plays an
              important role in making sure your webpage is accessible
              to the widest variety of users, including those who use
              assistive technologies such as screen readers.
              Not all elements are semantic, though. It is still common
              to see non-semantic elements such as DIV to create a
              division in the page, or SPAN to create an inline division.
              Sometimes these are simply the most efficient solution
              to a structural problem the developer is trying to solve.
              The most important thing to keep in mind is that it is
              best practice to use semantic elements whenever possible,
              especially when the content is visible to users.</li>

            <li>When working with visible HTML elements, the content is
              contained between an opening tag and a closing tag.
              These tags are most often represented by angle brackets
              with associated tag names contained inside (for example,HEAD.
              Closing tags begin with a forward slash (for example, HEAD).
              We insert the content between an opening tag and a closing tag
              so that the browser understands how to treat the content.</li>

            <li>The words “element” and “tag” are commonly used
              interchangeably in the web development world, but it is
              important to know the difference. An element refers to the
              entire element from opening tag to closing tag, whereas a
              tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>

            <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists,
              ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML
              elements represent bulleted or numbered lists. </li>
            <li>The IMG element contains information about images that are
              displayed on the webpage. The IMG element can contain
              various attributes; the src attribute is the most important
              because it defines the location of the image</li>

            <li>Order matters! When using headings, it is important that
              we use heading tags in order from H1 to H6 to make
              the page accessible to users who access the page using
              screen readers or other devices. In addition, the biggest
              heading, H1, should only appear once on each page.</li>

            <li>The alt text is important for screen readers and other
              assistive technologies. Alt text can also improve search
              engine rankings for your website.</li>

            <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development
              and refers to separating code into different files based
              on use. It is one of the key design principles that we practice
              in the boot camp. Separation of concerns is based on the
              idea that each section of code should have its own
              responsibility.</li>

            <li>Debugging is one of the most important parts of the
              development process. Every day, developers notice errors
              and review code that isn’t working. It’s important to get
              into the mindset that errors and mistakes are gifts. They
              tell us when something is wrong, and if we can stay
              curious, we can figure out what is happening and learn
              something new.</li>

    <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
          <h2>JavaScript</h2>
          <ul>

          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>

          <li>The .js file extension indicates that this file is a JavaScript file.

          <li>In coding parlance, a variable is simply a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>

          <li>To declare a variable in JavaScript, we have a few different options. Prior to more recent changes to
            JavaScript, we
            used the var keyword to create a variable in our code. You may see var from time to time, and it's a valid
            part of
            JavaScript, but it's important to note that all modern JavaScript uses new syntax, so we should avoid using
            var.</li>

          <li>The first variable keyword we might use is CONST. The const keyword allows us to create variables that
            can't be
            reassigned a value. It essentially "locks down" what that variable will be, and once we declare it, we can
            never
            reassign it. When writing JavaScript, we always want to start by declaring variables using const. The second
            variable
            keyword we might use is let. Finally, we use an assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we
            want stored in our variable. In the example
            involving a container named "shape" that stores a circle, we can express that in JavaScript as follows:
            const shape = "circle";
          </li>
          <li>Let's take a closer look at console.log. The word console refers to a test environment that developers use
            to check out
            their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by
            a computer.
            The .log() method will output whatever we add inside the parentheses to the console. To learn more about
            console.log,
            you can visit the MDN Web Docs on console.log Links to an external site..</li>
          </li>

          <li>What exactly do we mean by “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of
            the following
            values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other
            values, including
            a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy. To learn more about truthy and falsy values, visit
            the MDN Web
            Docs on truthy Links to an external site..</li>

          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.
            Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>

          <li>To create an array, we declare a variable in the same way that we declared a variable with only one data
            item. That is,
            we use const and then give the variable a name. However, instead of assigning the variable to a single
            value, we assign
            the variable to a group of values. The following variable declaration
            demonstrates how we would represent our group of shapes in an array
            named shapes:const shapes = ["triangle", "square", "pentagon", "circle"];
          </li>

          <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data. A
            single array can store different types of data, such as strings,
            numbers, and so on.</li>

          <li>The following array stores information about a student named Lu, including his name, age, and whether he
            is currently
            enrolled:
            const studentInfo = ["Lu", 54, true]; Notice that only the student's
            name, "Lu", is surrounded by quotation marks. That is because Lu is a
            string, and strings need to be contained within quotation marks. Since
            54 is a number and true is a Boolean value, no quotation marks are
            necessary for those values. As you can see, this array contains a
            string, a number, and a Boolean value.</li>

          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not
            all arrays
            must have multiple data types.</li>

          <li>To work with individual data items inside an array, we need to have one more piece of information: the
            location of the
            data item in the array. This location is identified with a unique number called an index. Using each piece
            of data's
            index, or location number, we can access individual data inside the array.</li>

          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. This means
            that the first
            item in any array has an index of 0, not 1. The indices, or location identifiers, will always be whole
            numbers that
            increase by 1 each time.</li>

          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by
            allowing a single
            code block to be executed over and over. Developers must use another statement, such as the conditional if
            statement
            that we just learned, to interrupt the control flow by executing a block of code a specific number of times.
          </li>

          <li>But what if we wanted to reassign the value of the variable over time?
            This is where we would use the let keyword. Just like with const, we use let, followed by a unique variable
            name and the
            assignment operator = to assign the specific data that we want stored in our variable. However, unlike with
            const, let
            allows us to reassign the value of the variable over time. This is especially important in cases where we
            need to use
            the variable to store changing values, like when iterating over an array using a for loop.</li>

          <li>A for loop contains the following three important statements:
            The first statement determines the starting point for our loop. Since we want to start at the beginning of
            the array, we
            declare a variable x and give it a value of 0 (because the first index of an array is always 0), as shown in
            the
            following line of code:
            let x = 0;
            The second statement is the condition. As long as the number in the variable x is less than the length of
            the array, the
            loop will keep running. This will allow the loop to execute one time for each item in the array. We use the
            length
            built-in array property on our shapes array to express that condition, as shown in the following line of
            code:
            x < shapes.length; The final statement is what allows the array to iterate over each item. Since indices
              follow a predictable pattern, we know the number increases by 1 each time. The code x++ is a shortcut way
              of writing x+1. Now every time the code loops, x will increase by 1, as shown in the following line of
              code: x++ </li>

          <li>Commenting out code makes it inactive without deleting it, just in
            case you need it later. To comment out multiple lines
            of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code</li>

          <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.
            A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically
            execute when the
            JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to
            execute it. While
            that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more
            easily
            reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need. Being able to call a function to execute it also
            means you
            can control where in the control flow a task is executed, or if it is executed at all.</li>
