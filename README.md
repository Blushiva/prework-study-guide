## Description
Boot Camp Prework Study Guide for Students

- I was motivated to do this project because I wanted a study guide that put all my notes and sources in one location that wasn't a notebook that would be tossed out after I finished the bootcamp course. I wanted this site to be a reminder of when I started learning coding at zero skill set level and a reminder of how far I have come as a coder with this course.

- I built this project to see if I could and also if I would even understand what I was doing.

- This website is a quick reference to skills that I will be using as a coder. 

- Upon completion of these notes, I have built a good outline of what an HTML website consists of. I have learned some HTML, Javascript, CSS, and GIT. When I started I knew nothing, I was brand new to coding.

This guide is to be used in sections.  Each Section has it's own topic and quick reference notes.  The topics are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. And if we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first.
